# Countdown - Create a function that accepts a number as an input. 
# Return a new list that counts down by one, from the number (as the 0th element) 
# down to 0 (as the last element). Example: countdown(5) should return [5,4,3,2,1,0]
def countdown(num):
    list = []
    for i in range(num, -1, -1):
        list.append(i)
    return list

print(countdown(5))
